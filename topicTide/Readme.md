<<ESTABLISHING BROKER AND PRODUCER CONNECTION>>

1. Broker is running on port 8080.
2. Producers connect via WebSocket.

In main.go:

1. Listen request of producer and consumer and forward it to broker.go

In broker.go: 

1. Handle Producer request like unmarshall json content from producer, sanitize topic name to create a file name etc.

In topic_manager.go:

1. Handle upcoming request from broker.go and transmit it to file_lock.go 

In file_lock.go:

1. Encrypt the content and apply lock to avoid critical conditions and then only write to a file
